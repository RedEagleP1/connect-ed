Connect=ed's mission is to discover what it takes to create meaningful virtual worlds.

## Description

P1 believes Connect=ed might be a great fit for Open Source. We want to test and see if that indeed is true by making our first module, foraging, open source as-of today!

* When working with art assets, we are using [Magicavoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/).
